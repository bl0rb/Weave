"""Shared TestClient/DB wiring for the backend test suite.

Centralized here (rather than duplicated per test file, as test_api.py used
to do) because app.dependency_overrides lives on the single `app` singleton
that's shared process-wide across every test module: two files independently
assigning app.dependency_overrides[get_db] would race on which one "wins"
for the whole session, since the assignment happens at import time (before
any test runs) and the last import wins. conftest.py is guaranteed by pytest
to be imported before any test module in this directory, so it's the one
place this can safely be set up once.

Auth is deliberately NOT bypassed here: only get_db is overridden.
test_api.py (pre-auth business-logic tests, written before Step 2) opts
into bypassing app.api.deps.get_current_user via its own autouse fixture;
test_auth_api.py exercises the real cookie-based login flow against this
same client.
