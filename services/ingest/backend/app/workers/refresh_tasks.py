"""Confluence-refresh scheduler: a self-re-enqueuing Celery task
(`confluence_refresh_tick`) that periodically starts a fresh crawl run for
every ImportSource with refresh_enabled=true whose interval has elapsed.

There is deliberately no Celery Beat in this deployment, so the recurring
tick is a chain of self-re-enqueued tasks: each execution re-sends itself
via `self.app.send_task(..., countdown=confluence_refresh_tick_seconds)`.
The chain is kicked off by the existing `worker_ready` hook in
app/workers/tasks.py (`celery_app.send_task('confluence_refresh_tick')`, by
name only -- this module is registered with the Celery app the same way
import_tasks.py/openwebui_tasks.py are, via an explicit import at the bottom
of tasks.py).

Singleton discipline (no Beat means nothing else guarantees only one chain
is ever running) is a Redis SET-NX-EX lock, styled after
tasks._try_acquire_recovery_lock -- but held and renewed for the chain's
entire lifetime rather than released after one startup action, since a
short-lived lock would let every later, unrelated worker restart start a
second competing chain even while the first one is perfectly healthy. The
winning token is threaded through the self-re-enqueue chain (the same way
import_confluence threads `chunk_seq`) and renewed once per tick
(_renew_refresh_lock, mirroring import_tasks._commit_owned's lease-guard: a
failed renewal means this execution was superseded, or the lock lapsed with
nobody holding it, and it must stop re-enqueuing itself either way). Every
`confluence_refresh_tick()` call -- both the token-less kickstart from
worker_ready and every self-re-enqueued continuation -- goes through the
same acquire-or-renew check, so a redundant kickstart from a simultaneous
multi-replica startup, or from a worker restarting years into an
already-healthy chain, is a harmless no-op rather than a second chain.

The refresh run itself reuses the existing `import_confluence` chunked crawl
task completely unchanged -- it is enqueued exactly like a user-started run
(see app/api/import_routes.create_import_run), just with
`options['is_refresh'] = True`. ImportRun has no dedicated "is this a
refresh" column (none was added by the schema change this feature builds
on); `options` is already an arbitrary JSON settings-snapshot per the model
docstring, so that is the "existing ImportRun pattern" this flag piggybacks
on instead of a new migration. The per-page diff against ImportPageState
(skip unchanged pages, version-chain changed ones) lives in
app/workers/import_tasks.py, gated on that same flag; the
last_refresh_at/last_refresh_error bookkeeping on ImportSource lives there
too (set when a refresh run reaches a terminal state).

Confluence path/space context (frontmatter `space` / `confluence_path` /
`parent_title` / `depth`, the breadcrumb line, and `path_tags` -- see
app/services/confluence.PageContext and app/workers/import_tasks.py's
_import_one_page) needs NO extra plumbing here: a refresh run is a normal
`import_confluence` crawl from the copied scope's root (frontier below), so
it goes through the exact same one-fetch_context-per-run root resolution and
per-page path threading as a manually started run -- a changed page's
re-import gets a freshly walked ancestor path (from the CURRENT tree
shape, not a stale cached one) at zero extra API cost per page.
