"""Outbound webhook delivery Celery task: sends one WebhookDelivery row's
event payload to its connection's URL, with retry/backoff for
transport-level and 5xx failures.

Webhooks are per-task opt-in, not a fan-out: dispatch_job_event/
dispatch_run_event below fire only when the job/import run was itself
explicitly configured with a webhook_connection_id (job.processing_info
['settings'] / run.options -- see app/api/routes.py's POST /upload, POST
/collections/{id}/start, and app/api/import_routes.py's create_import_run
for where that id is set and validated). A connection subscribed to the
event but never selected on the task gets nothing; the connection's own
`events` list still filters which of finished/failed actually send once a
connection *is* configured.

Registered from app/workers/tasks.py (the `celery -A app.workers.tasks`
entrypoint) via an explicit import;
app/api/webhook_routes.py and the completion hooks in app/workers/tasks.py /
app/workers/import_tasks.py enqueue by name only (`deliver_webhook`).

WebhookDelivery.status has no 'running' state (just 'pending' | 'sent' |
'failed' -- see app/models/models.py's docstring), so
there is no claim/reclaim dance here: a delivery simply stays 'pending'
across retries (each retry re-sends the same row, bumping `attempts`) until
it lands on a terminal 'sent' or 'failed'. Retries are self-re-enqueues with
a countdown -- the same `self.app.send_task(..., countdown=...)` pattern
app/workers/refresh_tasks.py uses for its tick chain -- rather than Celery's
built-in `self.retry`, since a countdown-based re-send is all a delivery
needs and this keeps the task's own return path linear (no exception-driven
control flow).

# was itself configured with a webhook_connection_id (see the module
# docstring), so there is at most one WebhookDelivery created per event here
# -- never a loop over "every connection subscribed to this event".
#
# This only ever creates a pending WebhookDelivery row and enqueues
# deliver_webhook by name (celery_app.send_task) -- no network call happens
# here, matching app/api/webhook_routes.send_webhook's own dispatch shape.
