"""Mirrors Celery WORKER process log records into the `worker_log_entries`
Postgres table so the admin UI can tail worker logs without docker.sock or
kubectl -- neither is available to the backend in the EKS/k8s deployment
(and the worker Deployment runs N replicas behind an HPA, so there is no
single node-local log file to tail even with host access; see
charts/weave-ingest/templates/worker-deployment.yaml). Read side is
GET /api/v1/auth/admin/worker-logs in app/api/auth.py.

Wiring: importing this module (from app/workers/celery_app.py) connects
`_attach_db_log_handler` to celery's `after_setup_logger` signal, which
fires once in the worker's MAIN process after Celery finishes configuring
the root logger -- NOT at import time. Attaching a handler any earlier
would be silently dropped: `worker_hijack_root_logger` (default True)
replaces the root logger's handlers during that same setup step. Because
this happens before the prefork pool forks its child processes, every
child (including ones spawned later by --max-tasks-per-child recycling)
inherits the handler via the fork's memory copy -- no per-child wiring
needed. With --pool=solo/threads (no fork at all) the same handler just
runs directly in the single process.

Fork safety for the DB connection itself: this module owns a dedicated
engine (deliberately NOT app.database.session.engine) with
os.register_at_fork(after_in_child=...) so a connection the main process
happens to have checked out at fork time is never reused by a forked
child -- two processes sharing one TCP socket silently corrupts the
postgres wire protocol. See SQLAlchemy's "Using Connection Pools with
Multiprocessing or os.fork()".
