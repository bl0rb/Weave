"""SSRF-safe HTTP(S) fetcher.

Used anywhere the backend fetches a URL supplied (directly or indirectly) by
an admin/user rather than hardcoded in config: OIDC discovery + the
`POST /auth/admin/providers/{id}/test` probe today, the Confluence importer
(Phase C) later.

Threat model: an attacker-controlled or attacker-influenced URL/hostname
must not be able to make the backend issue requests to internal
infrastructure (other pods/services, the cloud metadata endpoint, redis,
postgres, etc). Two things are required to actually close that off, not
just one:

1. Reject hostnames that resolve to a private/loopback/link-local/reserved
   address -- checked here.
2. Connect to the exact IP that was validated, not re-resolve the hostname
   when opening the socket. Otherwise a DNS-rebinding attacker returns a
   public IP to the validation check and a private one moments later to the
   actual connection (TOCTOU). Every request in this module is pinned to
   the validated IP via a custom http.client connection whose `connect()`
   is overridden; the original hostname is still sent as the `Host` header
   and TLS SNI/verification target so vhost routing and certificate checks
   still work normally.

Redirects are followed manually (stdlib http.client does not follow them)
so each hop gets the same scheme + DNS + IP validation as the original
request -- a 302 to a private address is exactly as dangerous as the
original URL pointing there.

Private targets can be selectively permitted via `allowed_private_hosts`
(admin-managed, e.g. an internal Confluence for the importer). The grant is
per-host, evaluated for EVERY redirect hop against that hop's hostname
(and, for `host:port` entries, its effective port) -- an allowlisted host
that redirects to a non-allowlisted private address is rejected at that
hop. Cloud-metadata addresses are blocked unconditionally; no allowlist
entry can override that.
