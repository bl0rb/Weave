# Firewall / Network Requirements

Connection matrix for Weave Ingest deployments (Docker Compose and Kubernetes/Helm).
All rows are TCP. "Required" means the app cannot operate without it; "optional"
rows depend on the listed feature being used.

An important architectural note up front: **the browser talks to the backend
API directly** — the frontend container does not proxy API requests. Users
therefore need network access to *both* the frontend and the backend (or to
both ingress hosts).

## Frontend (Next.js)

| Direction | Peer | Port | Purpose | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | User browsers / ingress controller | 3000 (or 443 via ingress) | Web UI | Required |
| Outbound | — | — | None. The frontend serves static/SSR content only; API calls originate from the browser. | — |

## Backend (FastAPI)

| Direction | Peer | Port | Purpose | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | User browsers / ingress controller | 8000 (or 443 via ingress) | REST API (UI, session auth) | Required |
| Inbound | API clients (n8n, scripts) | 8000 (or 443 via ingress) | REST API (session auth) | Optional |
| Outbound | PostgreSQL | 5432 | Jobs, users, sessions, results | Required |
| Outbound | Redis | 6379 | Celery broker/results, runtime settings | Required |
| Outbound | OIDC identity provider (e.g. `login.microsoftonline.com` for Entra ID, or your Keycloak host) | 443 | OIDC discovery, JWKS, token exchange | Optional — only when OIDC login is configured |
| Outbound | Confluence (`*.atlassian.net` for Cloud, or internal Server/DC `host:port`) | 443 / custom | Import source validation and synchronous test probes | Optional — Confluence import |

## Worker (Celery)

No inbound connections — the worker listens on no port.

| Direction | Peer | Port | Purpose | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outbound | Redis | 6379 | Celery broker/results, runtime settings | Required |
| Outbound | PostgreSQL | 5432 | Job state, results | Required |
| Outbound | PaddleOCR model hosts: `*.bcebos.com` (default BOS source, e.g. `paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com`); `huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs*.huggingface.co` when `PADDLE_PDX_MODEL_SOURCE=HuggingFace` | 443 | Runtime download of OCR model weights on first use / cold cache | Required for `ppocrv6_*`/`paddlevl` profiles unless the model cache is pre-warmed (persistent PVC / compose volume) or models are baked into the image. Without egress, jobs silently degrade to the plain-text fallback (no OCR). |
| Outbound | Confluence (`*.atlassian.net` for Cloud, or internal Server/DC `host:port`) | 443 / custom | Import crawl: page + attachment downloads run on the worker | Optional — Confluence import |
| Outbound | OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint (host from `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`) | 443 / custom | `openai_vision` profile sends page images for OCR | Optional — only with the `openai_vision` profile |

## PostgreSQL

| Direction | Peer | Port | Purpose | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | Backend, Worker | 5432 | Application database | Required |
| Inbound | Migration job (Kubernetes only; runs the backend image) | 5432 | Alembic migrations | Required (K8s with `migrationJob.enabled`) |
| Outbound | — | — | None | — |

## Redis

| Direction | Peer | Port | Purpose | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | Backend, Worker | 6379 | Celery broker/result backend, runtime settings, locks | Required |
| Outbound | — | — | None | — |

## Private/internal targets need an app-level allowlist too

Opening the firewall is necessary but **not sufficient** for any outbound peer
on a private address (RFC1918 `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, loopback,
link-local, IPv6 ULA). Every admin-supplied URL goes through the backend's
SSRF-safe fetcher, which rejects such targets by default — so a host can be
perfectly reachable at the TCP level from inside the pod and the app will still
refuse it with `... resolves to a blocked address (<ip>)`.

Allow the specific host per integration (exact hostname match, no wildcards;
a bare `host` entry matches any port, `host:port` pins the port):

| Integration | Env var | Helm value |
|---|---|---|
| Confluence import | `IMPORT_PRIVATE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | `importer.privateHostAllowlist` |
| OpenWebUI push | `OPENWEBUI_PRIVATE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | `openwebui.privateHostAllowlist` |
| Vision-language endpoint | `VL_PRIVATE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | `vl.privateHostAllowlist` |

The env values are JSON lists (`["wiki.corp.internal"]`); the Helm values are
YAML lists rendered into them. Set them for **both** the backend and the worker
deployment — the test probe runs in the backend, the import crawl and the push
run in the worker (the chart wires one value into both). The change is an
environment variable, so the pods must restart to pick it up.

The allowlist is re-evaluated on every redirect hop against that hop's own
hostname: if the internal server 3xx-redirects to a *different* internal host
(e.g. a canonical name or an SSO host), that host needs its own entry.
Cloud-metadata addresses stay blocked unconditionally and cannot be allowlisted.

## Deployment-specific notes

**Kubernetes / Helm chart**

- Only the frontend and backend Services need to be reachable from outside the
  cluster (via their ingresses, typically 443). Redis (bundled) and the model
  cache stay cluster-internal.
- With external PostgreSQL (the only mode the chart supports), backend, worker,
  and migration-job pods need egress to that database host on 5432.
- If worker egress to the model hosts is blocked, either allow the hosts above,
  route through a proxy (`worker.extraEnv`: `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`),
  switch the source (`PADDLE_PDX_MODEL_SOURCE`), and/or persist the cache
  (`worker.modelCache.persistence`) so the download happens once.
- Cluster nodes additionally need registry access to pull images
  (`ghcr.io` + `pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com`, 443) — usually covered
  by cluster-level infrastructure rules.

**Docker Compose (standard: `docker-compose.yml`)**

- Published host ports: `3000` (frontend) and `8000` (backend) only. PostgreSQL
  and Redis stay on the internal compose network and must not be exposed.
- The worker persists models in the `weave_ingest_paddlex_models` volume, so
  model-host egress is only needed until the cache is populated. The
  `docker-compose.nas.example.yml` overlay only moves that volume to a host
  path; it changes no ports and no egress.

**Docker Compose (development: `docker-compose.dev.yml`)**

- Additionally publishes `5432` and `6379` to the host for local development
  convenience. Do not use this file on a reachable network without firewalling
  those ports.
